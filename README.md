## Prerequisites

We are expecting our students to have a basic knowlege of:

- calculus, especially matrix calculus, differentiation
- linear algebra
- probability theory and statistics
- programming, especially on Python

Although if you don't have any of this, you could substitude it with your diligence
because the course provides additional materials to study requirements yourself.

## Materials for self-study

A lot of great materials are available online. See
[extra_materials.md](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-mipt/blob/master/extra_materials.md)
file for the whole list.

Informal "aggregation" of all topics by previous years students:

(in Russian) - useful for fast and furious exam passing.

Also lectures and seminars contains references to more detailed materials on topics.

## Docker image

Using docker for tasks evaluation is a good idea, prebuilt image is under cunstruction.
