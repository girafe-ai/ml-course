## Prerequisites

We are expecting our students to have a basic knowlege of:

- calculus, especially matrix calculus, differentiation
- linear algebra
- probability theory and statistics
- programming, especially on Python

Although if you don't have any of this, you could substitude it with your
diligence because the course provides additional materials to study requirements
yourself.

## Materials for self-study

A lot of great materials are available online. See
[extra materials](extra_materials.md) file for the whole list.Also lectures and
seminars contains references to more detailed materials on topics.

Lectures conspects are available for both [basic](lecture_notes_basic__ru.pdf)
and [advanced](lecture_notes_advanced__ru.pdf). Especially useful for fast and
furious exam passing. (Previous version of informal basic conspect is
[available](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-mipt/blob/spring_2019/ML_informal_notes.pdf))

## Docker image

Using docker for tasks evaluation is a good idea, prebuilt image is under
cunstruction.
