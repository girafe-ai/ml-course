# Machine Learning at MIPT
This course aims to introduce students to modern state of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is designed to take one year (two terms at MIPT) - approximately 2 * 15 lectures and seminars.

All learning materials are available here, full list of topics considered in the course are listed in `program_*.pdf` files

Organizational information about current launches available at [`ml-mipt.github.io`](https://ml-mipt.github.io/)

## Repository structure

* on `master` branch previous term materials are stored
    to give a quick and comprehensive overview
* on `basic` and `advanced` branches materials for
    current launches are being published
* tags (e.g. `spring_2019`) contain previous launches materials for convenience

## Prerequisites

We are expecting our students to have a basic knowlege of:
* calculus, especially matrix calculus, differentiation
* linear algebra
* probability theory and statistics
* programming, especially on Python

Although if you don't have any of this, you could substitude it with your diligence because the course provides additional materials to study requirements yourself.

## Extra theoretical materials

Informal "aggregation" of all topics by previous years students: [file](https://github.com/ml-mipt/ml-mipt/blob/spring_2019/ML_informal_notes.pdf) (in Russian) - useful for fast and furious exam passing

Also lectures and seminars contains references to more detailed materials on topicks

## Docker image

Using docker for tasks evaluation is a good idea, prebuilt image is under cunstruction
