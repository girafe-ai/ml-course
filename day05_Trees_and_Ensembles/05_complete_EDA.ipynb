    "**NEGATIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated**. A value **-1 means perfect negative correlation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as **MultiColinearity** as both of them contains almost the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "So do you think we should use both of them as **one of them is redundant**. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n",

    "## Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is a general ensemble method. It works by applying similar classifiers on small partitions of the dataset and then taking the average of all the predictions. Due to the averaging,there is reduction in variance. Unlike Voting Classifier, Bagging makes use of similar classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bagged KNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging works best with models with high variance. An example for this can be Decision Tree or Random Forests. We can use KNN with small value of **n_neighbours**, as small value of n_neighbours."
