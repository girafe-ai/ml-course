Your ulitmate goal is to implement all the basic blocks of the neural network in pure numpy. All the code you need is available in this directory. You may refer to the [week0_07 directory](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-course/tree/23f_basic/week0_07_intro_to_DL) as well.

Please, implement the modules (layers, loss functions, optimizers, etc.) in the `modules.ipynb`. Two layers (`Conv2d` and `MaxPool2d`) are optional and will give you a bit more challenge (and more points of course).

You can use the `test_modules.ipynb` notebook to test your code locally.

__To submit the assignment, convert your notebook with modules into `.py` file (File->Download as->Python (.py) in Jupyter) and upload it to the Contest.__

P.s. You will need the implemented layers in the Lab 2 as well. 

Good luck!
