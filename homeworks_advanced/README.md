# Homework rules

## Solutions

Homeworks plays significant role in your final grade so you have to solve them.

But we **kindly ask you** not to publish solutions (e.g. public repo on your GitHub account).
Because we aren't able to provide unique tasks for every run (although we update some every time).
Also it's no good in spoilering solutions to your fellows - they lose an occasion to practice ML.

It's good to have a repo with the task solved, so you could have a *private* repo either on GitHub with student account or on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or anywhere else.

You always live in a community, so please respect it's standards and guides.

### PEP 8
In our case [__PEP 8__](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is a standard. (Dare to open it - __it's made for humans!__)

[Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) contains reasonable extensions and motivations.

### Also don't forget about _this_
