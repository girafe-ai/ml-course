The layer will output an attention vector, $a_t$, that is the length of the source sentence, each element is between 0 and 1 and the entire vector sums to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this layer takes what we have decoded so far, $s_{t-1}$, and all of what we have encoded, $H$, to produce a vector, $a_t$, that represents which words in the source sentence we should pay the most attention to in order to correctly predict the next word to decode, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$. \n",

    "_Some additional notes coming next:_\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we calculate the *energy* between the previous decoder hidden state and the encoder hidden states. As our encoder hidden states are a sequence of $T$ tensors, and our previous decoder hidden state is a single tensor, the first thing we do is `repeat` the previous decoder hidden state $T$ times. We then calculate the energy, $E_t$, between them by concatenating them together and passing them through a linear layer (`attn`) and a $\\tanh$ activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_t = \\tanh(\\text{attn}(s_{t-1}, H))$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be thought of as calculating how well each encoder hidden state \"matches\" the previous decoder hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We currently have a **[dec hid dim, src sent len]** tensor for each example in the batch. We want this to be **[src sent len]** for each example in the batch as the attention should be over the length of the source sentence. This is achieved by multiplying the `energy` by a **[1, dec hid dim]** tensor, $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{a}_t = v E_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this as calculating a weighted sum of the \"match\" over all `dec_hid_dem` elements for each encoder hidden state, where the weights are learned (as we learn the parameters of $v$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we ensure the attention vector fits the constraints of having all elements between 0 and 1 and the vector summing to 1 by passing it through a $\\text{softmax}$ layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_t = \\text{softmax}(\\hat{a_t})$$\n",

    "This gives us the attention over the source sentence!\n",
