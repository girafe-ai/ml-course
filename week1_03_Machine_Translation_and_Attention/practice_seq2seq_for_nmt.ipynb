        "The most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are *encoder-decoder* models, which often use a *recurrent neural network* (RNN) to *encode* the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a *context vector*. You can think of the context vector as being an abstract representation of the entire input sentence. This vector is then *decoded* by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating it one word at a time.\n",

        "The above image shows an example translation. The input/source sentence, \"guten morgen\", is input into the encoder (green) one word at a time. We also append a *start of sequence* (`<sos>`) and *end of sequence* (`<eos>`) token to the start and end of sentence, respectively. At each time-step, the input to the encoder RNN is both the current word, $x_t$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $h_{t-1}$, and the encoder RNN outputs a new hidden state $h_t$. You can think of the hidden state as a vector representation of the sentence so far. The RNN can be represented as a function of both of $x_t$ and $h_{t-1}$:\n",

        "$$h_t = \\text{EncoderRNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n",

        "We're using the term RNN generally here, it could be any recurrent architecture, such as an *LSTM* (Long Short-Term Memory) or a *GRU* (Gated Recurrent Unit). \n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we have $X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\\}$, where $x_1 = \\text{<sos>}, x_2 = \\text{guten}$, etc. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is usually either initialized to zeros or a learned parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the final word, $x_T$, has been passed into the RNN, we use the final hidden state, $h_T$, as the context vector, i.e. $h_T = z$. This is a vector representation of the entire source sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we have our context vector, $z$, we can start decoding it to get the target sentence, \"good morning\". Again, we append start and end of sequence tokens to the target sentence. At each time-step, the input to the decoder RNN (blue) is the current word, $y_t$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $s_{t-1}$, where the initial decoder hidden state, $s_0$, is the context vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$, i.e. the initial decoder hidden state is the final encoder hidden state. Thus, similar to the encoder, we can represent the decoder as:\n",

        "\n",

The last thing we need to do is to create a `DataLoader` for our data, which will take our sentences and put them together to form a batch. Problem here lies in the fact that sentences can have different sizes and items in one batch absolutely cannot. For this we use padding (remember the `<pad>` token). Back in version `0.8` torchtext used to provide its own custom classes which handled tokenization, `<sos>`, `<eos>` and `<unk>` tokens and added padding. However, since that time, torchtext ditched this functionality in order to make their dataloading API consistent with PyTorch's one. This in turn means that padding (as well as everything else mentioned) ourselves. Luckily, PyTorch's `DataLoader` supports custom collate functions, which seems like a great place to do all our preprocessing, including padding.\n",

However, be careful, as the tutorial uses version `0.9` whilst the actual version for today is `0.11` and there have been slight differences introduced inbetween, but nothing as big as transition from `0.8` to `0.9`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Collate function (`collate_fn` optional argument in `DataLoader.__init__`) takes only one argument which is current data batch, collated into a python list, and should output a collated tensor. `DataLoader` supports different data formats for `Dataset`. Most common are a tuple or a dictionary of values. `DataLoader` takes these containers and collates them into the same typed container with lists of items, e.g. dictionary with same keys, but each key has a list of items or a tuple of lists. We are working with `Multi30k` data, which means that our `train_data` contains tuples of strings (`src` and `trg`). This means that our `collate_batch` function will receive a tuple of 2 lists of strings. And we need to collate them into a single `torch.tensor`. In order to do this, we first need to encode each string into a list of token indices (don't forget to reverse the `src` sequence) and pad them to a same length before creating a tensor. For padding we will use the PyTorch's `pad_sequence` function, which takes a list of tensors of different shapes and a padding value and returns the padded tensor."

Today, instead of plotting the training process with `matplotlib`, we will use a [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) to track our training process online. TensorBoard is an application by Google which allows to visualize training logs. In order for this to work, however, you need to store your logs in a local directory and using special data format. Luckily, PyTorch has a [module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html) which handles the data flow for us. We will see, how to work with this module in a minute, however, right now we need to start our tensorboard process, so that we can keep track of our progress on the go. Jupyter notebooks (and Google Colab) have a special extension to run tensorboard and display it in a notebook inplace. You can read more on that in this [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_in_notebooks). For now let's just copy-paste the required commands and move on.\n",
