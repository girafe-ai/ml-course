Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\"\n",

For this purpose, we at Mail.ru Computer Vision Team have created and implemented systems for smart image processing: search by object, by scene, by face, etc. Another spectacular technology is landmark recognition. Today, I am going to tell you how we made this a reality using Deep Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the situation: you return from your vacation with a load of photos. Talking to your friends, you are asked to show a picture of a place worth seeing, like palace, castle, pyramid, temple, lake, waterfall, mountain, and so on. You rush to scroll your gallery folder trying to find one that is really good. Most likely, it is lost amongst hundreds of images, and you say you will show it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We solve this problem by grouping user photos in albums. This will let you find pictures you need just in few clicks. Now we have albums compiled by face, by object and by scene, and also by landmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Photos with landmarks are essential because they often capture highlights of our lives (journeys, for example). These can be pictures with some architecture or wilderness in the background. This is why we seek to locate such images and make them readily available to users.\n",
