    "\n",
    "One notable property of Hebrew is that it's a consonant language. That is, there are no vowels in the written language. One could represent vowels with diacritics above consonants, but you don't expect people to do that in everyday life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, some Hebrew characters will correspond to several English letters and others - to none, so we should use encoder-decoder architecture to figure that out.\n",

    "Encoder-decoder architectures are about converting anything to anything, including\n",

    "We chose simplified __Hebrew->English__ machine translation for words and short phrases (character-level), as it is relatively quick to train even without a gpu cluster."

    "__Note:__ you can fit all 4 state tensors of both LSTMs into in a single state - just assume that it contains, for example, [h0, c0, h1, c1] - pack it in encode and update in decode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some cool ideas on what you can do then.\n",
    "\n",
    "__General tips & tricks:__\n",
    "* You will likely need to adjust pre-training time for such a network.\n",
    "* Supervised pre-training may benefit from clipping gradients somehow.\n",
    "* SCST may indulge a higher learning rate in some cases and changing entropy regularizer over time.\n",
    "* It's often useful to save pre-trained model parameters to not re-train it every time you want new policy gradient parameters.\n",
    "* When leaving training for nighttime, try setting REPORT_FREQ to a larger value (e.g. 500) not to waste time on it.\n",

    "__Formal criteria:__\n",
    "To get 5 points, we want you to build an architecture that:\n",
    "* _doesn't consist of single GRU_\n",
    "* _works better_ than single GRU baseline.\n",
    "* We also want you to provide either learning curve or trained model, preferably both\n",
    "* ... and write a brief report or experiment log describing what you did and how it fared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention\n",
    "There's more than one way to connect decoder to encoder\n",
    "  * __Vanilla:__ layer_i of encoder last state goes to layer_i of decoder initial state\n",
    "  * __Every tick:__ feed encoder last state _on every iteration_ of decoder.\n",
    "  * __Attention:__ allow decoder to \"peek\" at one (or several) positions of encoded sequence on every tick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective (and cool) of those is, of course, attention.\n",
    "You can read more about attention [in this nice blog post](https://distill.pub/2016/augmented-rnns/). The easiest way to begin is to use \"soft\" attention with \"additive\" or \"dot-product\" intermediate layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tips__\n",
    "* Model usually generalizes better if you no longer allow decoder to see final encoder state\n",
    "* Once your model made it through several epochs, it is a good idea to visualize attention maps to understand what your model has actually learned\n",
    "\n",
    "* There's more stuff [here](bonus_pytorch.ipynb)\n",
    "* If you opted for hard attention, we recommend [gumbel-softmax](https://blog.evjang.com/2016/11/tutorial-categorical-variational.html) instead of sampling. Also, please make sure soft attention works fine before you switch to hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UREX\n",
    "* This is a way to improve exploration in policy-based settings. The main idea is that you find and upweight under-appreciated actions.\n",
    "* Here's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZNyHoXgV7M&feature=youtu.be&t=3444)\n",
    " and an [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09321).\n",
    "* You may want to reduce batch size 'cuz UREX requires you to sample multiple times per source sentence.\n",
    "* Once you got it working, try using experience replay with importance sampling instead of (in addition to) basic UREX.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some additional ideas:\n",
    "* (advanced deep learning) It may be a good idea to first train on small phrases and then adapt to larger ones (a.k.a. training curriculum).\n",
    "* (advanced nlp) You may want to switch from raw utf8 to something like unicode or even syllables to make the task easier.\n",
    "* (advanced nlp) Since Hebrew words are written __with vowels omitted__, you may want to use a small Hebrew vowel markup dataset at `he-pron-wiktionary.txt`."
